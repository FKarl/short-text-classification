who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
cinematic poo . 
 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
earnest but heavy-handed . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
amazingly dopey . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
a bit too eager to please . 
aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
this is so bad . 
nothing about it fits . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
 " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
an ugly , revolting movie . 
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
it's exactly what you'd expect . 
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing .

enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
bland but harmless . 
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .

it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
doesn't amount to much of anything . 
a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
the film is strictly routine . 
sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .

herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised .

muddled , trashy and incompetent
here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .

a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .

what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .

it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either .

tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .

i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
the worst film of the year . 
soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .

plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .

there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .

all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) .

it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry .

too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
it's just plain boring . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
charming , if overly complicated . . . 
the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
in the end , there isn't much to it . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
the movie gets muted and routine . 
ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
a big fat pain . 
 . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
an extremely unpleasant film . 
without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers . 
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
two hours of junk . 
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
don't waste your money . 
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
silly , loud and goofy . 
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
collapses under its own meager weight . 
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
…its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .

the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
arty gay film . 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
breen's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting . 
feeble comedy . 
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .

a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
insufferably naive . 
 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
a lame comedy . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
a dreadful live-action movie . 
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .

a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard !

a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .

a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .

a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .

bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .

…the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
ecks this one off your must-see list . 
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
aggravating and tedious . 
anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
just not campy enough
ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips .

it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
they should have called it gutterball .

grating and tedious . 
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
routine and rather silly . 
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
too simple for its own good . 
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .

if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
more maudlin than sharp . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
…the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
fluffy and disposible .

well-made but mush-hearted . 
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
thoroughly awful . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
woody , what happened ? 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .

a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
a dreary movie . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .

predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
both awful and appealing . 
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away . 
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
too silly to take seriously . 
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
 . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
flat , misguided comedy . 
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
an awful snooze . 
a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
crikey indeed . 
a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
terrible . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
a little too pat for its own good . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
just plain silly . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
a well-acted , but one-note film . 
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
it bites hard . 
though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
 . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
woefully pretentious . 
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
for dance completists only . 
this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .

only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .

just a bloody mess .

a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '

nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .

it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
nothing about this movie works . 
the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
smothered by its own solemnity . 
an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
 . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
video games are more involving than this mess . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
it drowns in sap . 
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
boring and meandering . 
it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
it's just rather leaden and dull . 
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
under-rehearsed and lifeless
must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
laughably , irredeemably awful . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
 " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
i hate this movie
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
barely gets off the ground . 
it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
as vulgar as it is banal . 
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
 . . . too sappy for its own good . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
simplistic , silly and tedious . 
has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
 . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
banal and predictable . 
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
press the delete key . 
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
it's just not very smart . 
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
well-meaning but inert . 
 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
it tells more than it shows . 
there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
bearable . barely . 
any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
[at least] moore is a real charmer .
